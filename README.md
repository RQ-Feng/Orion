# Orion Lib
A maintained(maybe idk) fork of OrionLib.<br />
Maybe has some problem because my luau isn't very good

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Multi windows are not recommended because it's not support and so bugged.

# Lib loader:
```lua
OrionLib = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RQ-Feng/Orion/refs/heads/main/main.lua"))()
```
