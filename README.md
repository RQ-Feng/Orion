# Orion Lib
A maintained(maybe idk) fork of OrionLib.
Maybe has some problem bc my luau isn't very good

Lib loader:
```lua
local OrionLib = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RQ-Feng/Orion/refs/heads/main/main.lua"))()
```
If you want to use ui setting or something else,you need to set Orion as a global variable:
```lua
OrionLib = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RQ-Feng/Orion/refs/heads/main/main.lua"))()
```
